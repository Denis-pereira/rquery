Description: A 'SQL' query generator based on Edgar F. Codd's relational
    algebra and experience using 'SQL' and 'dplyr' at big data
    scale.  The design represents an attempt to make 'SQL' more teachable by
    denoting composition by a sequential pipeline notation instead of nested
    queries or functions.   The implementation delivers reliable high 
    performance data processing on large data systems such as `Spark`
    and databases. Package features include: data processing trees
    or pipelines as observable objects (able to report both columns
    produced and columns used), optimized 'SQL' generation as an explicit
    user visible modeling step, and convenience methods for applying query
    trees to in-memory 'data.frame's.
