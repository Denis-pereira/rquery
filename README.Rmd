# `rquery`

[`rquery`](https://winvector.github.io/rquery/) is a query generator based on [Codd's relational algebra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relational_algebra) (updated to reflect lessons learned from working with [`R`](https://www.r-project.org), [`SQL`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SQL), and [`dplyr`]( https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=dplyr) at big data scale in production).  One goal of this experiment is to see if `SQL` would be more fun teachable if it had a sequential data-flow or pipe notation.

`rquery` is currently recommended for user with `Spark` and `PostgreSQL` (and with non-window functionality with `RSQLite`).

To install: `devtools::install_github("WinVector/rquery")` or `install.packages("rquery")`.

A good place to start is the [`rquery` introductory vignette](https://winvector.github.io/rquery/articles/rquery_intro.html).

# Discussion

[`rquery`](https://github.com/WinVector/rquery) can be an excellent advanced `SQL`
training tool (it shows how some very deep `SQL` by composing `rquery` operators).  Currently `rquery` is biased towards the `Spark` and `PostgeSQL` `SQL` dialects.

There are many prior relational algebra inspired specialized query languages.  Just a few include:

  * [`Alpha`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alpha_(programming_language)) ~1971.
  * [`QUEL`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/QUEL_query_languages) ~1974.
  * [`SQL`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SQL) ~1986.
  * [`Tutorial D`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/D_(data_language_specification)#Tutorial_D) ~2000.
  * [`data.table`](http://r-datatable.com/) ~2006.
  * [`LINQ`](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb308959.aspx) ~2007.
  * [`pandas`](http://pandas.pydata.org) ~2008.
  * [`dplyr`](http://dplyr.tidyverse.org) ~2014.
 
`rquery` is realized as a thin translation to an underlying `SQL` provider.  We are trying to put the Codd relational operators front and center (using the original naming, and back-porting `SQL` progress such as window functions to the appropriate relational operator).

The primary relational operators include:

  * [`extend()`](https://winvector.github.io/rquery/reference/extend_nse.html).  Extend adds derived columns to a relation table.  With a sufficiently powerful `SQL` provider this includes ordered and partitioned window functions.  This operator also includes built-in [`seplyr`](https://winvector.github.io/seplyr/)-style [assignment partitioning](https://winvector.github.io/seplyr/articles/MutatePartitioner.html).  `extend()` can also alter existing columns, though we note this is not always a relational operation (it can lose row uniqueness).
  * [`project()`](https://winvector.github.io/rquery/reference/project_nse.html).  Project is usually *portrayed* as the equivalent to column selection, though the original definition includes aggregation.  In our opinion the original relational nature of the operator is best captured by moving `SQL`'s "`GROUP BY`" aggregation functionality.
  * [`natural_join()`](https://winvector.github.io/rquery/reference/natural_join.html).  This a specialized relational join operator, using all common columns as an equi-join condition.
  * [`theta_join()`](https://winvector.github.io/rquery/reference/theta_join_nse.html).  This is the relational join operator allowing an arbitrary matching predicate.
  * [`select_rows()`](https://winvector.github.io/rquery/reference/theta_join_nse.html).  This is Codd's relational row selection.  Obviously `select` alone is an over-used and now ambiguous term (for example: it is already used as the "doit" verb in `SQL` and the *column* selector in `dplyr`).
  * [`rename_columns()`](https://winvector.github.io/rquery/reference/rename_columns.html).  This operator renames sets of columns.
  
The primary non-relational (traditional `SQL`) operators are:

  * [`select_columns()`](https://winvector.github.io/rquery/reference/select_columns.html).  This allows choice of columns (central to `SQL`), but is not a relational operator as it can damage row-uniqueness.
  * [`orderby()`](https://winvector.github.io/rquery/reference/orderby.html). Row order is not a concept in the relational algebra (and also not maintained in most `SQL` implementations). This operator is only useful when used with its `limit=` option, or as the last step as data comes out of the relation store and is moved to `R` (where row-order is usually maintained).
  * [`map_column_values()`](https://winvector.github.io/rquery/reference/map_column_values.html) re-map values in columns (very useful for re-coding data).
  * [`unionall()`](https://winvector.github.io/rquery/reference/unionall.html) concatenate tables.


The primary missing relational operators are:

  * Union.
  * Direct set difference, anti-join.
  * Division.


A great benefit of Codd's relational algebra is it gives one concepts to decompose complex data transformations into sequences of simpler transformations. 

Some reasons `SQL` seems complicated include:

  * `SQL`'s realization of sequencing as nested function composition. 
  * `SQL` uses some relational concepts as steps, others as modifiers and predicates.
  
  
A lot of the grace of the Codd theory can be recovered through the usual trick changing function composition notation from `g(f(x))` to `x . f() . g()`.  This experiment is asking (and not for the first time): "what if `SQL` were piped (expressed composition as a left to right flow, instead of a right to left nesting)?"

Let's work a non-trivial example: the `dplyr` pipeline 
from [Letâ€™s Have Some Sympathy For The Part-time R User](http://www.win-vector.com/blog/2017/08/lets-have-some-sympathy-for-the-part-time-r-user/).

library("rquery")
use_spark <- FALSE

if(use_spark) {
  my_db <- sparklyr::spark_connect(version='2.2.0', 
                                   master = "local")
  cname <- rq_connection_name(my_db)
  rquery::setDBOption(my_db, 
                      "create_options",
                      "USING PARQUET OPTIONS ('compression'='snappy')")
} else {
  driver <- RPostgreSQL::PostgreSQL()
  my_db <- DBI::dbConnect(driver,
                          host = 'localhost',
                          port = 5432,
                          user = 'johnmount',
                          password = '')
}

dbopts <- rq_connection_tests(my_db)
print(dbopts)
options(dbopts)
print(getDBOption(my_db, "control_rownames"))

# copy data in so we have an example
d_local <- build_frame(
   "subjectID", "surveyCategory"     , "assessmentTotal", "irrelevantCol1", "irrelevantCol2" |
   1          , "withdrawal behavior", 5                , "irrel1"        , "irrel2"         |
   1          , "positive re-framing", 2                , "irrel1"        , "irrel2"         |
   2          , "withdrawal behavior", 3                , "irrel1"        , "irrel2"         |
   2          , "positive re-framing", 4                , "irrel1"        , "irrel2"         )
rq_copy_to(my_db, 'd',
            d_local,
            temporary = TRUE, 
            overwrite = TRUE)

# produce a hande to existing table
d <- db_td(my_db, "d")
```

Note: in examples we use `rq_copy_to()` to create data.  This is only for the purpose of having
easy portable examples.  With big data the data is usually already in the remote database or
Spark system. The task is almost always to connect and work with this pre-existing remote data
and the method to do this is [`db_td()`](https://winvector.github.io/rquery/reference/db_td.html),
which builds a reference to a remote table given the table name.  The suggested pattern for working with 
remote tables is to get inputs via [`db_td()`](https://winvector.github.io/rquery/reference/db_td.html)
and land remote results with [`materialze()`](https://winvector.github.io/rquery/reference/materialize.html).
To work with local data one can copy data from memory to the database with [`rq_copy_to()`](https://winvector.github.io/rquery/reference/rq_copy_to.html)
and bring back results with [`execute()`](https://winvector.github.io/rquery/reference/execute.html) (though be aware 
operation on remote non-memory data is `rquery`'s primary intent).

First we show the Spark/database version of the original example data:

```{r dbdat}
class(my_db)
print(d)

d %.>%
  execute(my_db, .) %.>%
  knitr::kable(.)
```

Now we re-write the original calculation in terms of the `rquery` SQL generating operators.

```{r calc}
scale <- 0.237

dq <- d %.>%
  extend_nse(.,
             probability :=
               exp(assessmentTotal * scale))  %.>% 
  normalize_cols(.,
                 "probability",
                 partitionby = 'subjectID') %.>%
  pick_top_k(.,
             partitionby = 'subjectID',
             orderby = c('probability', 'surveyCategory'),
             reverse = c('probability')) %.>% 
  rename_columns(., 'diagnosis' := 'surveyCategory') %.>%
  select_columns(., c('subjectID', 
                      'diagnosis', 
                      'probability')) %.>%
  orderby(., cols = 'subjectID')
```

We then generate our result:

```{r res}
dq %.>%
  execute(my_db, .) %.>%
  knitr::kable(.)
```

We see we have quickly reproduced the original result using the new database operators.  This means such a calculation could easily be performed at a "big data" scale (using a database or `Spark`; in this case we would not take the results back, but instead use `CREATE TABLE tname AS` to build a remote materialized view of the results).

The actual `SQL` query that produces the result is, in fact, quite involved:

```{r q, comment=''}
cat(to_sql(dq, my_db, source_limit = 1000))
```

The query is large, but due to its regular structure it should be very amenable to query optimization.

A feature to notice is: the query was automatically restricted to just columns actually needed from the source table to complete the calculation. This has the possibility of decreasing data volume and greatly speeding up query performance. Our [initial experiments](https://github.com/WinVector/rquery/blob/master/extras/PerfTest.md) show `rquery` narrowed queries to be twice as fast as un-narrowed `dplyr` on a synthetic problem simulating large disk-based queries.  We think if we connected directly to `Spark`'s relational operators (avoiding the `SQL` layer) we may be able to achieve even faster performance.

The above optimization is possible because the `rquery` representation is an intelligible tree of nodes, so we can interrogate the tree for facts about the query.  For example:

```{r qfacts}
column_names(dq)

tables_used(dq)

columns_used(dq)
```


The additional record-keeping in the operator nodes allows checking and optimization (such as [query narrowing](http://www.win-vector.com/blog/2017/12/how-to-greatly-speed-up-your-spark-queries/)).  The flow itself is represented as follows:

```{r pqp, comment=''}
cat(format(dq))
```

```{r diagram, fig.width=8, fig.height=8, eval=FALSE}
dq %.>%
  op_diagram(.) %.>% 
  DiagrammeR::grViz(.)
```

![](https://github.com/WinVector/rquery/raw/master/tools/pipe_diagram.png)

`rquery` also includes a number of useful utilities (both as nodes and as functions).

```{r utils}
quantile_cols(my_db, "d")
rsummary(my_db, "d")

dq %.>% 
  quantile_node(.) %.>%
  execute(my_db, .)

dq %.>% 
  rsummary_node(.) %.>%
  execute(my_db, .)
```

We have found most big-data projects either require joining very many tables (something `rquery` join planners help with, please see [here](https://github.com/WinVector/rquery/blob/master/extras/JoinController.md) and [here](https://github.com/WinVector/rquery/blob/master/extras/JoinController.md)) or they require working with wide data-marts (where `rquery` query narrowing helps, please see [here](https://github.com/WinVector/rquery/blob/master/extras/PerfTest.md)).


We can also stand `rquery` up on non-`DBI` sources such as [`SparkR`](https://github.com/WinVector/rquery/blob/master/extras/SparkR.md)
and also [`data.table`](https://github.com/WinVector/rquery/blob/master/extras/data_table.md).  The `data.table` adapter is being developed in the [`qdatatable`](https://github.com/WinVector/qdatatable) package, and can be [quite fast](https://github.com/WinVector/rquery/blob/master/extras/data_table.md).  Notice also the examples in this paragram all essentially use the same query pipeline, the user can choose where to apply it: in memory (`data.table`), in a `DBI` database (`PostgreSQL`, `Sparklyr`), and with even non-DBI systems (`SparkR`).
